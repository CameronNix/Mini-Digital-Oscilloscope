# Mini-Digital-Oscilloscope
A compact digital oscilloscope built using an ESP32 microcontroller to visualize analog voltage signals over time. The system samples real-time ADC data, buffers time-ordered samples, and renders voltage-vs-time waveforms on a 128×64 OLED display with adjustable time scaling.
